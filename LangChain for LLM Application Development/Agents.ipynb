Mitchell won the Brownlow Medal as the league's best and fairest player in 2018 and set the record for the most disposals in a VFL/AFL match, accruing 54 in a game against Collingwood during that season.

      "Summary: Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.\n",
      "ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. When applied to business problems, it is known under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods.\n",
      "The mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning. \n",
      "From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.\n",

      "Machine learning â€“ a subfield of soft computing within computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a \"field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\". Machine learning involves the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. These algorithms operate by building a model from an example training set of input observations to make data-driven predictions or decisions expressed as outputs, rather than following strictly static program instructions.\u001b[0m\n",
